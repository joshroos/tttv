Many years ago there lived a little boy whose name was Antonio Canova .
He lived with his grandfather because his own father was dead . 
His grandfather was a stonecutter and he was very poor . 
Antonio was a puny lad and not strong enough to work . 
He did not care to play with the other boys of the town . 
But he liked to go with his grandfather to the stoneyard . 
While the old man was busy , cutting and trimming the great blocks of stone , the lad would play among the chips . 
Sometimes he would make a little statue of soft clay . 
Sometimes he would take hammer and chisel and try to cut a statue from a piece of rock . 
He showed so much skill that his grandfather was delighted . 
The boy will be a sculptor some day . 
Then when they went home in the evening . 
What have you been doing today , my little sculptor ?
She would take him upon her lap and sing to him . 
She would tell him stories that filled his mind with pictures of wonderful and beautiful things . 
And the next day , when he went back to the stoneyard , he would try to make some of those pictures in stone or clay . 
There lived in the same town a rich man who was called the Count . 
Sometimes the Count would have a grand dinner , and his rich friends from other towns would come to visit him .
